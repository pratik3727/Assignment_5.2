#1. P value in problem 2
# If alpha value is 5%, then Zscore is less then -1.96 or greater than 1.96
X<- pnorm(1.96, 0, 1)
x


#2.How do you test the proportions and compare against hypothetical props? Test Hypothesis: proportion of automatic cars is 40%.

#Null hypothesis is proportion of automatic cars is 40%

#Alternate hypothesis is proportion of automatic cars is not 40%


#To test proportion we need to find Z value , also mean and standard deviation
